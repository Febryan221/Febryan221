Song emotion recognition on RAVDESS song dataset   

A simple tutorial/demonstration on deep learning application for emotion recognition from song data.  

## Tested on:  
Tensorflow:  2.5 and 2.6  
Librosa: 8.1  

## Dataset 
The dataset is included in this repo. This part of RAVDESS [1] dataset with song data only.
Since it has a license "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0", we can provide it here.

## What will you learn
In this tutorial you will learn:  
1. How to extract acoustic features  
2. How to build classifier: NN/MLP/FCN/Dense, LSTM, CNN  
3. How to split dataset into training and test  
4. How to make speaker-independent partition  

Life after this (based on problem you're facing):    
1. Try to extract other acoustic features
2. Try other classifiers
3. Try to other datasets
